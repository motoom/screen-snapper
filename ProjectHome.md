Snapper enables you to make screenshots easily.

To make a screenshot, press 'PrtSc' (the PrintScreen key).
The screenshot will be saved automatically in a JPG file.

You can have Snapper halve the size of the screenshot, to
save space, or have it overlay text on it.
It also automatically puts the date and time in the filename of the screenshot.

On the 'All snaps' page you will see an overview of
all the screenshots in the folder you chose for storing your
screenshots.  This will default to the folder where you
placed this program in.

If you close Snapper, it will put itself in the tray.
Use the 'Unload Snapper' button or popup menu item
to remove it from memory.
